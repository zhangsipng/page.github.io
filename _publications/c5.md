Existing RA research mainly focus on unsupervised and fully-supervised methods. The former lack external supervision to optimize performance, while the latter are costly because of expensive labeling effort required for training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a quantum-inspired interactive ranking aggregation (QI-IRA) method, which (1) utilizes quantum theory to interpret and model the generation and aggregation of multiple basic rankings, (2) approximates or even exceeds the performance of fully-supervised RA methods with much less labeling cost, even as low as only two feedbacks per query on Market1501, MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets. Comparative experiments conducted on six public re-ID datasets validate the superiority of the proposed QI-IRA method over existing unsupervised, interactive, and fully-supervised RA approaches.}, number={3}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Hu, Chunyu and Zhang, Hong and Liang, Chao and Huang, Hao}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={2202-2210} }"

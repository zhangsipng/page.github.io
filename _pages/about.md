I am currently a Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, and also serve as Deputy Director of the Department of Intelligent Science. I completed my postdoctoral research at the Postdoctoral Research Station of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University in July 2014, with a research focus on video analysis and retrieval. In July 2012, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where my research focused on computer vision and pattern recognition. I have presided over 5 national and provincial-level fund projects, published more than 70 academic papers, and hold 13 authorized invention patents.
